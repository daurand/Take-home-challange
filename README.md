# Instructions

We are given a top-secret algorithm to optimize which driver delivers to which location, by finding the highest suitability score. This algorithm runs in the command line and takes two text files as input

To use this algorithm clone this repository. Navigate to the clone in your command line using "cd". Then run this command

```bash
node topSecret.js <location_file> <driver_file>
```

Replace <location_file> and <driver_file> with the respective paths to the .txt files you wish to pass in as arguments. For example, if the two files are named destinations.txt and drivers.txt, the command would be

```bash
node topSecret.js destinations.txt drivers.txt.
```
